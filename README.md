#JS Polyfills

This repository contains implementations of few ES5 methods which I use on daily basis.

It does not cover all new features from ES5, it's main goal is to be as thin as possible.

If you need more advanced features I recommend you:

* [es5-shim](http://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/)
* [Xccessors](http://purl.eligrey.com/github/Xccessors)
* [getters and setters](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/09/07/transitioning-existing-code-to-the-es5-getter-setter-apis.aspx)
